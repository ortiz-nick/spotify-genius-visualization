# spotify-genius-visualization
Utilize the Spotify API to pull your recently listened to songs (up to 50).  Then pass the list of artists and track names to the Genius API to return the lyrics of those songs.  Save the result to a database then iterate over the data to visualize various questions about your listening history.
